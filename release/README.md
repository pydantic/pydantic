To create a new release:
1. Edit `pydantic/version.py` to set the new version number.
2. **(If the new version is a new minor or major release)** run `pre-commit run -a usage_docs` to update the usage links in docstrings.
3. Run `pdm run release/make_history.py` to update `HISTORY.md`
4. **Important:** review the changes in `HISTORY.md` and make sure the markdown is valid - in particular, check text that should be in `code-blocks` is.
5. Create a pull request with these changes.
6. Once the pull request is merged, create a new release on GitHub, the tag should be `v{VERSION}`, the title should be `v{VERSION} {DATE}` and the body can be auto-generated by GitHub.
7. Ask someone to approve the release once CI has run.
