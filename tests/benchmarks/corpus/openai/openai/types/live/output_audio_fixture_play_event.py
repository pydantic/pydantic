The entire payload is validated before model speech is interrupted and input is muted. Only one fixture can be active. fixture.playing acknowledges acceptance and fixture.played reports server mixer drain. These notifications are not exact transport-media boundaries. Input arriving during playback is dropped and not replayed.
