[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) is the Python library for
[property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/).
Hypothesis can infer how to construct type-annotated classes, and supports builtin types,
many standard library types, and generic types from the
[`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and
[`typing_extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) modules by default.

From Pydantic v1.8 and [Hypothesis v5.29.0](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#v5-29-0),
Hypothesis will automatically load support for [custom types](/usage/types/) like
`PaymentCardNumber` and `PositiveFloat`, so that the
[`st.builds()`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.builds)
and [`st.from_type()`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.from_type)
strategies support them without any user configuration.

!!! warning
    Please note, while the plugin supports these types, hypothesis will(currently) generate values outside
    of given args for the constrained function types.

### Example tests

```py
import typing

from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, PaymentCardNumber, PositiveFloat


class Model(BaseModel):
    card: PaymentCardNumber
    price: PositiveFloat
    users: typing.List[EmailStr]


@given(st.builds(Model))
def test_property(instance):
    # Hypothesis calls this test function many times with varied Models,
    # so you can write a test that should pass given *any* instance.
    assert 0 < instance.price
    assert all('@' in email for email in instance.users)


@given(st.builds(Model, price=st.floats(100, 200)))
def test_with_discount(instance):
    # This test shows how you can override specific fields,
    # and let Hypothesis fill in any you don't care about.
    assert 100 <= instance.price <= 200
```

### Use with JSON Schemas

To test client-side code, you can use [`Model.model_json_schema()`](usage/models/) with the
[`hypothesis-jsonschema` package](https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-jsonschema/)
to generate arbitrary JSON instances matching the schema.
For web API testing, [Schemathesis](https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io) provides
a higher-level wrapper and can detect both errors and security vulnerabilities.
