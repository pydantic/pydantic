The last few months have involved a whirlwind of work, and we're finally ready to announce to official release of
Pydantic V2!

## Getting started with Pydantic V2

To get started with Pydantic V2, install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install -U pydantic
```

Pydantic V2 is compatible with Python 3.7 and above.

See [the docs](../index.md) for examples of Pydantic at work.

## Migration guide

If you are upgrading an existing project, you can use our extensive [migration guide](../migration.md) to understand
what has changed.

If you do encounter any issues, please [create an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug+V2%2Cunconfirmed&projects=&template=bug-v2.yml)
using the `bug V2` label.
This will help us to actively monitor and track errors, and to continue to improve the library’s performance.

Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your feedback.
