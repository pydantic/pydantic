Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

Pydantic has a few dependencies:

* [`pydantic-core`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-core/): Core validation logic for _pydantic_ written in rust.
* [`typing-extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/): Backport of the standard library `typing` module.
* [`annotated-types`](https://pypi.org/project/annotated-types/): Reusable constraint types to use with `typing.Annotated`.

If you've got Python 3.7+ and `pip` installed, you're good to go.

Pydantic is also available on [conda](https://www.anaconda.com) under the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org)
channel:
