The primary means of defining objects in *pydantic* is via models 
(models are simply classes which inherit from `BaseModel`).

You can think of models as similar to types in strictly typed languages, or as the requirements of a single endpoint
in an API.

Untrusted data can be passed to a model, and after parsing and validation *pydantic* guarantees that the fields
of the resultant model instance will conform to the field types defined on the model.

!!! note
    *pydantic* is primarily a parsing library, **not a validation library**.
    Validation is a means to an end: building a model which conforms to the types and constraints provided.

    In other words, *pydantic* guarantees the types and constraints of the output model, not the input data.

    This might sound like an esoteric distinction, but it is not. If you're unsure what this means or
    how it might effect your usage you should read the section about [Data Conversion](#data-conversion) below.

## Basic model usage

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'Jane Doe'
```
`User` here is a model with two fields `id` which is an integer and is required, 
and `name` which is a string and is not required (it has a default value). The type of `name` is inferred from the
default value, and so a type annotation is not required (however note [this](#field-ordering) warning about field 
order when some fields do not have type annotations).
```py
user = User(id='123')
```
`user` here is an instance of `User`. Initialisation of the object will perform all parsing and validation,
if no `ValidationError` is raised, you know the resulting model instance is valid.
```py
assert user.id == 123
```
fields of a model can be accessed as normal attributes of the user object
the string '123' has been cast to an int as per the field type
```py
assert user.name == 'Jane Doe'
```
name wasn't set when user was initialised, so it has the default value
```py
assert user.__fields_set__ == {'id'}
```
the fields which were supplied when user was initialised:
```py
assert user.dict() == dict(user) == {'id': 123, 'name': 'Jane Doe'}
```
either `.dict()` or `dict(user)` will provide a dict of fields, but `.dict()` can take numerous other arguments.
```py
user.id = 321
assert user.id == 321
```
This model is mutable so field values can be changed.

### Model properties

The example above only shows the tip of the iceberg of what models can do. 
Models possess the following methods and attributes:

`dict()`
: returns a dictionary of the model's fields and values; 
  cf. [exporting models](exporting_models.md#modeldict)

`json()`
: returns a JSON string representation `dict()`; 
  cf. [exporting models](exporting_models.md#modeljson)

`copy()`
: returns a deep copy of the model; cf. [exporting models](exporting_models.md#modeldcopy)

`parse_obj()`
: a utility for loading any object into a model with error handling if the object is not a dictionary;
  cf. [helper functions](#helper-functions)

`parse_raw()`
: a utility for loading strings of numerous formats; cf. [helper functions](#helper-functions)

`parse_file()`
: like `parse_raw()` but for files; cf. [helper function](#helper-functions)

`from_orm()`
: loads data into a model from an arbitrary class; cf. [ORM mode](#orm-mode-aka-arbitrary-class-instances)

`schema()`
: returns a dictionary representing the model as JSON Schema; cf. [Schema](schema.md)

`schema_json()`
: returns a JSON string representation of `schema()`; cf. [Schema](schema.md)

`fields`
: a dictionary of the model class's fields

`__config__`
: the configuration class for the model, cf. [model config](model_config.md)

`__fields_set__`
: the set of names of fields which were set when the model instance was initialised

## Recursive Models

More complex hierarchical data structures can be defined using models themselves as types in annotations.

```py
{!./examples/recursive.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

For self-referencing models, see [postponed annotations](postponed_annotations.md#self-referencing-models).

## ORM Mode (aka Arbitrary Class Instances)

Pydantic models can be created from arbitrary class instances to support models that map to ORM objects.

To do this:
1. The [Config](model_config.md) property `orm_mode` must be set to `True`.
2. The special constructor `from_orm` must be used to create the model instance.

The example here uses SQLAlchemy, but the same approach should work for any ORM.

```py
{!./examples/orm_mode.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

ORM instances will be parsed with `from_orm` recursively as well as at the top level.

Here a vanilla class is used to demonstrate the principle, but any ORM class could be used instead.

```py
{!./examples/orm_mode_recursive.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

Arbitrary classes are processed by *pydantic* using the `GetterDict` class
(see [utils.py](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/pydantic/utils.py)), which attempts to
provide a dictionary-like interface to any class. You can customise how this works by setting your own
sub-class of `GetterDict` as the value of `Config.getter_dict` (see [config](model_config.md)).

You can also customise class validation using [root_validators](validators.md#root-validators) with `pre=True`. 
In this case your validator function will be passed a `GetterDict` instance which you may copy and modify.

## Error Handling

*pydantic* will raise `ValidationError` whenever it finds an error in the data it's validating.

!!! note
    Validation code should not raise `ValidationError` itself, but rather raise `ValueError`, `TypeError` or
    `AssertionError` (or subclasses of `ValueError` or `TypeError`) which will be caught and used to populate
    `ValidationError`.

One exception will be raised regardless of the number of errors found, that `ValidationError` will
contain information about all the errors and how they happened.

You can access these errors in a several ways:

`e.errors()`
: method will return list of errors found in the input data.

`e.json()`
: method will return a JSON representation of `errors`.

`str(e)`
: method will return a human readable representation of the errors.

Each error object contains:

`loc`
: the error's location as a list. The first item in the list will be the field where the error occurred,
  and if the field is a [sub-model](models.md#recursive_models), subsequent items will be present to indicate
  the nested location of the error.

`type`
: a computer-readable identifier of the error type.

`msg`
: a human readable explanation of the error.

`ctx`
: an optional object which contains values required to render the error message.

As a demonstration:

```py
{!./examples/errors1.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is". `json()` has `indent=2` set by default, but I've tweaked the
JSON here and below to make it slightly more concise.)_

### Custom Errors

In your custom data types or validators you should use `ValueError`, `TypeError` or `AssertionError` to raise errors.

See [validators](validators.md) for more details on use of the `@validator` decorator.

```py
{!./examples/errors2.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

You can also define your own error classes, which can specify a custom error code, message template, and context:

```py
{!./examples/errors3.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

## Helper Functions

*Pydantic* provides three `classmethod` helper functions on models for parsing data:

* **`parse_obj`**: this is very similar to the `__init__` method of the model, except it takes a dict
  rather than keyword arguments. If the object passed is not a dict a `ValidationError` will be raised.
* **`parse_raw`**: this takes a *str* or *bytes* and parses it as *json*, then passes the result to `parse_obj`.
  Parsing *pickle* data is also supported by setting the `content_type` argument appropriately.
* **`parse_file`**: this reads a file and passes the contents to `parse_raw`. If `content_type` is omitted,
  it is inferred from the file's extension.

```py
{!./examples/parse.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

!!! warning
    To quote the [official `pickle` docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html),
    "The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data.
    Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source." 
    
!!! info
    Because it can result in arbitrary code execution, as a security measure, you need
    to explicitly pass `allow_pickle` to the parsing function in order to load `pickle` data.

## Generic Models

!!! note
    New in version **v0.29**.

    This feature requires Python 3.7+.

Pydantic supports the creation of generic models to make it easier to reuse a common model structure.

In order to declare a generic model, you perform the following steps:

* Declare one or more `typing.TypeVar` instances to use to parameterize your model.
* Declare a pydantic model that inherits from `pydantic.generics.GenericModel` and `typing.Generic`,
  where you pass the `TypeVar` instances as parameters to `typing.Generic`.
* Use the `TypeVar` instances as annotations where you will want to replace them with other types or
  pydantic models.

Here is an example using `GenericModel` to create an easily-reused HTTP response payload wrapper:

```py
{!./examples/generics.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

If you set `Config` or make use of `validator` in your generic model definition, it is applied
to concrete subclasses in the same way as when inheriting from `BaseModel`. Any methods defined on
your generic class will also be inherited.

Pydantic's generics also integrate properly with mypy, so you get all the type checking
you would expect mypy to provide if you were to declare the type without using `GenericModel`.

!!! note
    Internally, pydantic uses `create_model` to generate a (cached) concrete `BaseModel` at runtime,
    so there is essentially zero overhead introduced by making use of `GenericModel`.

If the name of the concrete subclasses is important, you can also override the default behavior:

```py
{!./examples/generics-naming.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

## Dynamic model creation

There are some occasions where the shape of a model is not known until runtime. For this *pydantic* provides
the `create_model` method to allow models to be created on the fly.

```py
{!./examples/dynamic_model_creation.py!}
```

Here `StaticFoobarModel` and `DynamicFoobarModel` are identical.

Fields are defined by either a tuple of the form `(<type>, <default value>)` or just a default value. The
special key word arguments `__config__` and `__base__` can be used to customise the new model. This includes
extending a base model with extra fields.

```py
{!./examples/dynamic_inheritance.py!}
```

## Custom Root Types

Pydantic models which do not represent a `dict` ("object" in JSON parlance) can have a custom
root type defined via the `__root__` field. The root type can be of any type: list, float, int, etc.

The root type is defined via the type hint on the `__root__` field.
The root value can be passed to model `__init__` via the `__root__` keyword argument or as
the first and only argument to `parse_obj`.

```py
{!examples/custom_root_field.py!}
```

## Faux Immutability

Models can be configured to be immutable via `allow_mutation = False`. When this is set, attempting to change the
values of instance attributes will raise errors. See [model config](model_config.md) for more details on `Config`.

!!! warning
    Immutability in python is never strict. If developers are determined/stupid they can always
    modify a so-called "immutable" object.

```py
{!./examples/mutation.py!}
```

Trying to change `a` caused an error, and `a` remains unchanged. However, the dict `b` is mutable, and the
immutability of `foobar` doesn't stop `b` from being changed.

## Abstract Base Classes

Pydantic models can be used alongside Python's
[Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) (ABCs).

```py
{!./examples/ex_abc.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

## Field Ordering

Field order is important in models for the following reasons:

* validation is performed in the order fields are defined; [fields validators](validators.md) 
  can access the values of earlier fields, but not later ones
* field order is preserved in the model [schema](schema.md)
* field order is preserved in [validation errors](#error-handling)
* field order is preserved by [`.dict()` and `.json()` etc.](exporting_models.md#modeldict)

As of **v1.0** all fields with annotations (whether annotation-only or with a default value) will precede
all fields without an annotation. Within their respective groups, fields remain in the order they were defined.

```py
{!./examples/field_order.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

!!! warning
    As demonstrated by the example above, combining the use of annotated and non-annotated fields
    in the same model can result in surprising field orderings. (This is due to limitations of python.)

    Therefore, **we recommend adding type annotations to all fields**, even when a default value
    would determine the type by itself.

## Required fields

To declare a field as required, you may declare it using just an annotation, or you may use an ellipsis (`...`) 
as the value:

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Model(BaseModel):
    a: int
    b: int = ...
```

Here both `a` and `b` are required. However, use of ellipses for required fields does not work well
with [mypy](mypy.md), and as of **v1.0** should be avoided in most cases.

## Data Conversion

*pydantic* may cast input data to force it to conform to model field types,
and in some cases this may result in a loss of information.
For example:

```py
{!./examples/data_conversion.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

This is a deliberate decision of *pydantic*, and in general it's the most useful approach. See 
[here](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/578) for a longer discussion on the subject.
