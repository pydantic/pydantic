Where possible *pydantic* uses [standard library types](#standard-library-types) to define fields thus smoothing 
the learning curve. For some types however no standard library type exists, 
here *pydantic* implements [many commonly used types](#pydantic-types). If no existing type exists for your 
purpose you can also implement your [own types](#custom-data-types) with custom properties and validation.

## Standard Library Types

*pydantic* supports many common types from the python standard library. If you need stricter processing see 
[Strict Types](#strict-types); if you need to constrain the values allowed (e.g. to require a positive int) see
[Constrained Types](#constrained-types).

`bool`
: see [Booleans](#booleans) below for details on how bools are validated and what values are permitted

`int`
: *pydantic* uses `int(v)` to coerce types to an `int`, therefore strings and floats will be coerced
  to ints, see [this](models.md#data-conversion) warning on loss of information during data conversion

`float` 
: similarly `float(v)` is used to coerce values to floats

`str`
: strings are accepted as-as, `int` `float` and `Decimal` are coerced using `str(v)`, `bytes` and `bytearray` are
  converted using `v.decode()`, enums inheriting from `str` are converted using `v.value`, 
  all other types cause an error

`bytes`
: `bytes` are accepted as-as, `bytearray` is converted using `bytes(v)`, `str` are converted using `v.encode()`,
  `int` `float` and `Decimal` are coerced using `str(v).encode()`

`list`
: allows `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset` or generators and casts to a list, see `typing.List` below
  for sub-type constraints

`tuple`
: allows `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset` or generators and casts to a tuple, see `typing.Tuple` below
  for sub-type constraints

`dict`
: `dict(v)` is used to attempt to convert a dictionary, see `typing.Dict` below
  for sub-type constraints

`set`
: allows `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset` or generators and casts to a set, see `typing.Set` below
  for sub-type constraints

`frozonset`
: allows `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset` or generators and casts to a frozen set, see `typing.FrozenSet` below
  for sub-type constraints

`datetime.datetime`
: see [Datetime Types](#datetime-types) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`datetime.timedelta`
: see [Datetime Types](#datetime-types) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Union`
: see [Unions](#unions) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Optional`
: `Optional[x]` is simply short hand for `Union[x, None]`, see [Unions](#unions) below for more detail on 
  parsing and validation

`typing.Set`
: see [Typing Iterables](#typing-iterables) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.FrozenSet`
: see [Typing Iterables](#typing-iterables) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Sequence`
: see [Typing Iterables](#typing-iterables) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Type`
: see [Type](#type) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Callable`
: see [Callable](#callable) below for more detail on parsing and validation

`typing.Pattern`
: will cause the input value to be passed to `re.compile(v)` to create a regex pattern

`ipaddress.IPv4Address`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv4Address(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`ipaddress.IPv4Interface`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv4Address(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`ipaddress.IPv4Network`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv4Network(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`ipaddress.IPv6Address`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv6Address(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`ipaddress.IPv6Interface`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv6Interface(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`ipaddress.IPv6Network`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `IPv6Network(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other custom IP address types

`enum.Enum`
: checks that the value is a valid member of the enum, 
  see [Enums and Choices](#enums-and-choices) for more details

`enum.IntEnum`
: checks that the value is a valid member of the integer enum, 
  see [Enums and Choices](#enums-and-choices) for more details

`decimal.Decimal`
: *pydantic* attempts to convert the value to a string, then passes the string to `Decimal(v)`

`pathlib.Path`
: simply uses the type itself for validation by passing the value to `Path(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other more strict path types

`uuid.UUID`
: strings and bytes (converted to strings) are allowed passed to `UUID(v)`, 
  see [Pydantic Types](#pydantic-types) for other more strict UUID types

### Typing Iterables

*pydantic* uses standard library `typing` types as defined in PEP 484 to define complex objects.

```py
{!./examples/ex_typing.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

### Unions

The `Union` type allows a model attribute to accept different types, e.g.:

!!! warning
    This script is complete, it should run "as is". However, it may not reflect the desired behavior; see below.

```py
{!./examples/union_type_incorrect.py!}
```

However, as can be seen above, *pydantic* will attempt to 'match' any of the types defined under `Union` and will use
the first one that matches. In the above example the `id` of `user_03` was defined as a `uuid.UUID` class (which
is defined under the attribute's `Union` annotation) but as the `uuid.UUID` can be marshalled into an `int` it
chose to match against the `int` type and disregarded the other types.

As such, it is recommended that when defining `Union` annotations that the most specific type is defined first and
followed by less specific types. In the above example, the `UUID` class should precede the `int` and `str`
classes to preclude the unexpected representation as such:

```py
{!./examples/union_type_correct.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

### Enums and Choices

*pydantic* uses python's standard `enum` classes to define choices.

```py
{!./examples/choices.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_


### Datetime Types

*Pydantic* supports the following [datetime](https://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#available-types)
types:

* `datetime` fields can be:

  * `datetime`, existing `datetime` object
  * `int` or `float`, assumed as Unix time, e.g. seconds (if <= `2e10`) or milliseconds (if > `2e10`) since 1 January 1970
  * `str`, following formats work:

    * `YYYY-MM-DD[T]HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]][Z[±]HH[:]MM]]]`
    * `int` or `float` as a string (assumed as Unix time)

* `date` fields can be:

  * `date`, existing `date` object
  * `int` or `float`, see `datetime`
  * `str`, following formats work:

    * `YYYY-MM-DD`
    * `int` or `float`, see `datetime`

* `time` fields can be:

  * `time`, existing `time` object
  * `str`, following formats work:

    * `HH:MM[:SS[.ffffff]]`

* `timedelta` fields can be:

  * `timedelta`, existing `timedelta` object
  * `int` or `float`, assumed as seconds
  * `str`, following formats work:

    * `[-][DD ][HH:MM]SS[.ffffff]`
    * `[±]P[DD]DT[HH]H[MM]M[SS]S` (ISO 8601 format for timedelta)

```py
{!./examples/datetime_example.py!}
```

### Booleans

!!! warning
    The logic for parsing `bool` fields has changed as of version **v1.0**.

    Prior to **v1.0**, `bool` parsing never failed, leading to some unexpected results.
    The new logic is described below.

A standard `bool` field will raise a `ValidationError` if the value is not one of the following:

* A valid boolean (i.e. `True` or `False`),
* The integers `0` or `1`,
* a `str` which when converted to lower case is one of
  `'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'`
* a `bytes` which is valid (per the previous rule) when decoded to `str`

Here is a script demonstrating some of these behaviors:

```py
{!./examples/boolean.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

### Callable

Fields can also be of type `Callable`:

```py
{!./examples/callable.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

!!! warning
    Callable fields only perform a simple check that the argument is
    callable, no validation of arguments, their types or the return
    type is performed.

### Type

*pydantic* supports the use of `Type[T]` to specify that a field may only accept classes (not instances)
that are subclasses of `T`.

```py
{!./examples/type_type.py!}
```

You may also use `Type` to specify that any class is allowed.

```py
{!./examples/bare_type_type.py!}
```

## Literal Type

!!! note
    This is not strictly part of the python standard library, instead the 
    [typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) package is required.

*pydantic* supports the use of `typing_extensions.Literal` as a lightweight way to specify that a field
may accept only specific literal values:

```py
{!./examples/literal1.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

One benefit of this field type is that it can be used to check for equality with one or more specific values
without needing to declare custom validators:

```py
{!./examples/literal2.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

With proper ordering in an annotated `Union`, you can use this to parse types of decreasing specificity:

```py
{!./examples/literal3.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_


## Pydantic Types

*pydantic* comes with the following types:

`FilePath`
: like `Path` but the path must exist and be a file

`DirectoryPath`
: like `Path` but the path must exist and be a directory

`EmailStr`
: requires [email-validator](https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator) to be installed, requires the input
  string to be a valid email address, outputs a simple string

`NameEmail`
: requires [email-validator](https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator) to be installed, requires the input
  string to be a valid email address, outputs a `NameEmail` object which has two properties: `name` and `email`, 
  also accepts emails in the format `Fred Bloggs <fred.bloggs@example.com>` in which case "Fred Bloggs" is used
  for name, if simply `fred.bloggs@example.com` is provided, name would be "fred.bloggs"

`PyObject`
: expects a string and loads the python object at that dotted path; e.g. if `'math.cos'` was provided, the resulting
  field value would be the function `cos`

`Color`
: for parsing HTML can CSS colors, see [Color Type](#color-type)

`Json`
: a special type wrapper which parses JSON before parsing, see [JSON Type](#json-type)

: a redis DSN style URL, see [URLs](#urls)

`stricturl`
: a type method for arbitrary URL constraints, see [URLs](#urls)

`UUID1`
: requires a valid UUID of type 1, see `UUID` [above](#standard-library-types)

`UUID3`
: requires a valid UUID of type 3, see `UUID` [above](#standard-library-types)

`UUID4`
: requires a valid UUID of type 4, see `UUID` [above](#standard-library-types)

`UUID5`
: requires a valid UUID of type 5, see `UUID` [above](#standard-library-types)

`SecretBytes`
: bytes where the value is kept partially secret, see [Secrets](#secret-types) 

`SecretStr`
: string where the value is kept partially secret, see [Secrets](#secret-types)

`IPvAnyAddress`
: allows either a `IPv4Address` or a `IPv6Address`

`IPvAnyInterface`
: allows either a `IPv4Interface` or a `IPv6Interface`

`IPvAnyNetwork`
: allows either a `IPv4Network` or a `IPv6Network`

`NegativeFloat`
: allows a float which is negative, uses standard `float` parsing, then checks the value is less than 0,
  see [Constrained Types](#constrained-types)

`NegativeInt`
: allows a int which is negative, uses standard `int` parsing, then checks the value is less than 0,
  see [Constrained Types](#constrained-types)

  see [Constrained Types](#constrained-types)

### URLs

For URI/URL validation the following types are available:

- `AnyUrl`: any scheme allowed, TLD not required
- `AnyHttpUrl`: schema `http` or `https`, TLD not required
- `HttpUrl`: schema `http` or `https`, TLD required, max length 2083
- `PostgresDsn`: schema `postgres` or `postgresql`, userinfo required, TLD not required
- `RedisDsn`: schema `redis`, userinfo required, tld not required
- `stricturl`, method with the following keyword arguments:
    - `strip_whitespace: bool = True`
    - `min_length: int = 1`
    - `max_length: int = 2 ** 16`
    - `tld_required: bool = True`
    - `allowed_schemes: Optional[Set[str]] = None`

If you require custom types they can be created in a similar way to the application specific types defined above.

The above types (which all inherit from `AnyUrl`) will attempt to give descriptive errors when invalid URLs are
provided:

```py
{!./examples/urls.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

#### URL Properties

Assuming an input URL of `http://samuel:pass@example.com:8000/the/path/?query=here#fragment=is;this=bit`,
the above types export the following properties:

- `scheme`: always set - the url schema (`http` above)
- `host`: always set - the url host (`example.com` above)
- `host_type`: always set - describes the type of host, either:

  - `domain`: e.g. `example.com`,
  - `int_domain`: international domain, see [below](#international-domains), e.g. `exampl£e.org`,
  - `ipv4`: an IP V4 address, e.g. `127.0.0.1`, or
  - `ipv6`: an IP V6 address, e.g. `2001:db8:ff00:42`

- `user`: optional - the username if included (`samuel` above)
- `password`: optional - the password if included (`pass` above)
- `tld`: optional - the top level domain (`com` above),
  **Note: this will be wrong for any two-level domain, e.g. "co.uk".** You'll need to implement your own list of TLDs
  if you require full TLD validation
- `port`: optional - the port (`8000` above)
- `path`: optional - the path (`/the/path/` above)
- `query`: optional - the URL query (aka GET arguments or "search string") (`query=here` above)
- `fragment`: optional - the fragment (`fragment=is;this=bit` above)

If further validation is required, these properties can be used by validators to enforce specific behaviour:

```py
{!./examples/url_properties.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

#### International Domains

"International domains" (e.g. a URL where the host includes non-ascii characters) will be encoded via
[punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode) (see
[this article](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/) for a good description of why this is important):

```py
{!./examples/url_punycode.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

#### Underscores in Hostnames

!!! note
    In *pydantic* underscores are allowed in all parts of a domain except the tld.
    Technically this might be wrong - in theory the hostname cannot have underscores, but subdomains can.

    To explain this; consider the following two cases:

    - `exam_ple.co.uk`: the hostname is `exam_ple`, which should not be allowed since it contains an underscore
    - `foo_bar.example.com` the hostname is `example`, which should be allowed since the underscore is in the subdomain

    Without having an exhaustive list of TLDs, it would be impossible to differentiate between these two. Therefore
    underscores are allowed, but you can always do further validation in a validator if desired.

    Also, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all currently accept `http://exam_ple.com` as a URL, so we're in good
    (or at least big) company.

### Color Type

You can use the `Color` data type for storing colors as per
[CSS3 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color). Colors can be defined via:

- [name](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#ColorKeywords) (e.g. `"Black"`, `"azure"`)
- [hexadecimal value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet)
  (e.g. `"0x000"`, `"#FFFFFF"`, `"7fffd4"`)
- RGB/RGBA tuples (e.g. `(255, 255, 255)`, `(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`)
- [RGB/RGBA strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#RGB_colors)
  (e.g. `"rgb(255, 255, 255)"`, `"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)"`)
- [HSL strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#HSL_colors)
  (e.g. `"hsl(270, 60%, 70%)"`, `"hsl(270, 60%, 70%, .5)"`)

```py
{!./examples/ex_color_type.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

`Color` has the following methods:

**`original`**
: the original string or tuple passed to `Color`

**`as_named`**
: returns a named CSS3 color; fails if the alpha channel is set or no such color exists unless
  `fallback=True` is supplied, in which case it falls back to `as_hex`

**`as_hex`**
: returns a string in the format `#fff` or `#ffffff`; will contain 4 (or 8) hex values if the alpha channel is set,
  e.g. `#7f33cc26`

**`as_rgb`**
: returns a string in the format `rgb(<red>, <green>, <blue>)`, or `rgba(<red>, <green>, <blue>, <alpha>)`
  if the alpha channel is set

**`as_rgb_tuple`**
: returns a 3- or 4-tuple in RGB(a) format. The `alpha` keyword argument can be used to define whether
  the alpha channel should be included;
  options: `True` - always include, `False` - never include, `None` (default) - include if set

**`as_hsl`**
: string in the format `hsl(<hue deg>, <saturation %>, <lightness %>)`
  or `hsl(<hue deg>, <saturation %>, <lightness %>, <alpha>)` if the alpha channel is set

**`as_hsl_tuple`**
: returns a 3- or 4-tuple in HSL(a) format. The `alpha` keyword argument can be used to define whether
  the alpha channel should be included;
  options: `True` - always include, `False` - never include, `None` (the default)  - include if set

The `__str__` method for `Color` returns `self.as_named(fallback=True)`.

!!! note
    the `as_hsl*` refer to hue, saturation, lightness "HSL" as used in html and most of the world, **not**
    "HLS" as used in python's `colorsys`.

### Secret Types

You can use the `SecretStr` and the `SecretBytes` data types for storing sensitive information
that you do not want to be visible in logging or tracebacks.
The `SecretStr` and `SecretBytes` will be formatted as either `'**********'` or `''` on conversion to json.

```py
{!./examples/ex_secret_types.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

### Json Type

You can use `Json` data type - *Pydantic* will first parse raw JSON string and then will validate parsed object
against defined Json structure if it's provided.

```py
{!./examples/ex_json_type.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

### Payment Card Numbers

The `PaymentCardNumber` type validates [payment cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card)
(such as a debit or credit card).

```py
{!./examples/payment_card_number.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

`PaymentCardBrand` can be one of the following based on the BIN:

* `PaymentCardBrand.amex`
* `PaymentCardBrand.mastercard`
* `PaymentCardBrand.visa`
* `PaymentCardBrand.other`

The actual validation verifies the card number is:

* a `str` of only digits
* [luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) valid
* the correct length based on the BIN, if Amex, Mastercard or Visa, and between
  12 and 19 digits for all other brands

## Constrained Types

The value of numerous common types can be restricted using `con*` type functions:

```py
{!./examples/constrained_types.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

## Strict Types

You can use the `StrictStr`, `StrictInt`, `StrictFloat`, and `StrictBool` types
to prevent coercion from compatible types.
These types will only pass validation when the validated value is of the respective type or is a subtype of that type.
This behavior is also exposed via the `strict` field of the `ConstrainedStr`, `ConstrainedFloat` and
`ConstrainedInt` classes and can be combined with a multitude of complex validation rules.

The following caveats apply:

- `StrictInt` (and the `strict` option of `ConstrainedInt`) will not accept `bool` types,
    even though `bool` is a subclass of `int` in Python. Other subclasses will work.
- `StrictFloat` (and the `strict` option of `ConstrainedFloat`) will not accept `int`.

```py
{!./examples/strict_types.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_

## Custom Data Types

You can also define your own data types. The classmethod `__get_validators__` will be called
to get validators to parse and validate the input data.

```py
{!./examples/custom_data_types.py!}
```
_(This script is complete, it should run "as is")_
