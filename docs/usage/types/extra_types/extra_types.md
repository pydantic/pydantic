For types that are more complex, or don't need to be on Pydantic itself, we have the [Pydantic Extra Types] project.

{{ install_pydantic_extra_types }}

The following types are supported by [Pydantic Extra Types]:

* [Color Types](color_types.md) &mdash; color validation types.
* [Payment Card Numbers](payment_cards.md) &mdash; a type that allows you to store payment card numbers in your model.
