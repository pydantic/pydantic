# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will endeavour to support:
* the most recent minor release with bug fixes
* the latest minor release from the last major version
  for 6 months after a new major version is released with critical bug fixes
* all versions if a security vulnerability is found provided 1) upgrading to a later version is non-trivial 2)
  sufficient people are using that version to make support worthwhile

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find what you think might be a security vulnerability with pydantic,
please do not create an issue on github. Instead please email s@muelcolvin.com
I'll reply to your email promptly and try to get a patch out ASAP.
