# This workflow is a daily cron job, inspired by https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/.github/workflows/third_party.yml
# running the tests of various third-party libraries that use pydantic. This helps us spot regressions early,
# and helps flag when third-party libraries are making incorrect assumptions that might cause them to break when we cut a new release.
