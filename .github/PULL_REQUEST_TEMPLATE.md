# WARNING!!!

We're currently in the process of rewriting pydantic in preparation for V2, see
https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/blog/pydantic-v2/.

As a result, much of the codebase will change significantly over the coming months.

To avoid wasting your time, please only create Pull Requests if you've got explicit approval by a maintainer.

Otherwise, your pull requests may be closed without review.

Thank you for your interest in pydantic, and your patience. :pray:

**Note:** if you're making a pull request to fix pydantic v1.10, please make it against the `1.10.X-fixes` branch.
