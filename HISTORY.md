  Use `.get_default()` method on fields in `__fields__` attribute instead, #1732 by @PrettyWood
* Rearrange CI to run linting as a separate job, split install recipes for different tasks, #2020 by @samuelcolvin
* Allows subclasses of generic models to make some, or all, of the superclass's type parameters concrete, while 
  also defining new type parameters in the subclass, #2005 by @choogeboom

  when `validate_assignment = True` in model config, #1999 by @me-ransh

* Support home directory relative paths for `dotenv` files (e.g. `~/.env`), #1803 by @PrettyWood
* Clarify documentation for `parse_file` to show that the argument
  should be a file *path* not a file-like object, #1794 by @mdavis-xyz
* Fix false positive from mypy plugin when a class nested within a `BaseModel` is named `Model`, #1770 by @selimb
* add basic support of Pattern type in schema generation, #1767 by @PrettyWood
* Support custom title, description and default in schema of enums, #1748 by @PrettyWood
* Properly represent `Literal` Enums when `use_enum_values` is True, #1747 by @noelevans

* Modify validators for `conlist` and `conset` to not have `always=True`, #1682 by @samuelcolvin

* Document default `regex` anchoring semantics, #1648 by @yurikhan
* Use `chain.from_iterable` in class_validators.py. This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`.
  Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never
  stored as a huge list. This can save on both runtime and memory space, #1642 by @cool-RR
* Add `conset()`, analogous to `conlist()`, #1623 by @patrickkwang

* Call `__modify_schema__` only for the field schema, #1552 by @PrettyWood

* Added support for UUID instantiation through 16 byte strings such as `b'\x12\x34\x56\x78' * 4`. This was done to support `BINARY(16)` columns in sqlalchemy, #1541 by @shawnwall
* Add a test assertion that `default_factory` can return a singleton, #1523 by @therefromhere
* Add `NameEmail.__eq__` so duplicate `NameEmail` instances are evaluated as equal, #1514 by @stephen-bunn

  if possible and by not setting a default value in the schema, #1491 by @PrettyWood
* Added docs about dumping dataclasses to JSON, #1487 by @mikegrima
* Make `BaseModel.__signature__` class-only, so getting `__signature__` from model instance will raise `AttributeError`, #1466 by @MrMrRobat
* include `'format': 'password'` in the schema for secret types, #1424 by @atheuz
* Modify schema constraints on `ConstrainedFloat` so that `exclusiveMinimum` and
  minimum are not included in the schema if they are equal to `-math.inf` and
  `exclusiveMaximum` and `maximum` are not included if they are equal to `math.inf`, #1417 by @vdwees
* Squash internal `__root__` dicts in `.dict()` (and, by extension, in `.json()`), #1414 by @patrickkwang
* Move `const` validator to post-validators so it validates the parsed value, #1410 by @selimb
* Fix model validation to handle nested literals, e.g. `Literal['foo', Literal['bar']]`, #1364 by @DBCerigo
* Remove `user_required = True` from `RedisDsn`, neither user nor password are required, #1275 by @samuelcolvin
* Remove extra `allOf` from schema for fields with `Union` and custom `Field`, #1209 by @mostaphaRoudsari

* Confirm that shallow `model.copy()` does make a shallow copy of attributes, #1383 by @samuelcolvin
* Renaming `model_name` argument of `main.create_model()` to `__model_name` to allow using `model_name` as a field name, #1367 by @kittipatv
* Replace raising of exception to silent passing  for non-Var attributes in mypy plugin, #1345 by @b0g3r
* Remove `typing_extensions` dependency for python 3.8, #1342 by @prettywood
