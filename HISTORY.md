## v1.10.0 (2022-08-30)

* Refactor the whole _pydantic_ `dataclass` decorator to really act like its standard lib equivalent.
  It hence keeps `__eq__`, `__hash__`, ... and makes comparison with its non-validated version possible.
  It also fixes usage of `frozen` dataclasses in fields and usage of `default_factory` in nested dataclasses.
  The support of `Config.extra` has been added.
  Finally, config customization directly via a `dict` is now possible, [#2557](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/2557) by @PrettyWood
  <br/><br/>
  **BREAKING CHANGES:**
  - The `compiled` boolean (whether _pydantic_ is compiled with cython) has been moved from `main.py` to `version.py`
  - Now that `Config.extra` is supported, `dataclass` ignores by default extra arguments (like `BaseModel`)

Pre-release, see [the GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v1.10.0a1) for details.

## v1.9.2 (2022-08-11)

**Revert Breaking Change**: _v1.9.1_ introduced a breaking change where model fields were
deep copied by default, this release reverts the default behaviour to match _v1.9.0_ and before,
while also allow deep-copy behaviour via `copy_on_model_validation = 'deep'`. See [#4092](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/4092) for more information.

* Allow for shallow copies of model fields, `Config.copy_on_model_validation` is now a str which must be
  `'none'`, `'deep'`, or `'shallow'` corresponding to not copying, deep copy & shallow copy; default `'shallow'`,

* Add `NonNegativeInt`, `NonPositiveInt`, `NonNegativeFloat`, `NonPositiveFloat`, [#1975](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1975) by @mdavis-xyz
* Use % for percentage in string format of colors, [#1960](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1960) by @EdwardBetts
* Fixed issue causing `KeyError` to be raised when building schema from multiple `BaseModel` with the same names declared in separate classes, [#1912](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1912) by @JSextonn
* Add `rediss` (Redis over SSL) protocol to `RedisDsn`
  Allow URLs without `user` part (e.g., `rediss://:pass@localhost`), [#1911](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1911) by @TrDex
* Add a new `frozen` boolean parameter to `Config` (default: `False`).
  Setting `frozen=True` does everything that `allow_mutation=False` does, and also generates a `__hash__()` method for the model. This makes instances of the model potentially hashable if all the attributes are hashable, [#1880](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1880) by @rhuille
* fix schema generation with multiple Enums having the same name, [#1857](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1857) by @PrettyWood

* use `enum` for `typing.Literal` in JSON schema, [#1350](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1350) by @PrettyWood
* Fix: some recursive models did not require `update_forward_refs` and silently behaved incorrectly, [#1201](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1201) by @PrettyWood
* Fix bug where generic models with fields where the typevar is nested in another type `a: List[T]` are considered to be concrete. This allows these models to be subclassed and composed as expected, [#947](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/947) by @daviskirk
* Add `Config.copy_on_model_validation` flag. When set to `False`, _pydantic_ will keep models used as fields
  untouched on validation instead of reconstructing (copying) them, [#265](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/265) by @PrettyWood

## v1.7.4 (2021-05-11)

* **Security fix:** Fix `date` and `datetime` parsing so passing either `'infinity'` or `float('inf')`
  (or their negative values) does not cause an infinite loop,
  See security advisory [CVE-2021-29510](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh)

* add port check to `AnyUrl` (can't exceed 65536) ports are 16 insigned bits: `0 <= port <= 2**16-1` src: [rfc793 header format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1), [#1654](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1654) by @flapili
* Document default `regex` anchoring semantics, [#1648](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1648) by @yurikhan
* Use `chain.from_iterable` in class_validators.py. This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`.
  Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never
  stored as a huge list. This can save on both runtime and memory space, [#1642](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1642) by @cool-RR
* Add `conset()`, analogous to `conlist()`, [#1623](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1623) by @patrickkwang

* Adjust handling of root validators so that errors are aggregated from _all_ failing root validators, instead of reporting on only the first root validator to fail, [#1586](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1586) by @beezee
* Make `__modify_schema__` on Enums apply to the enum schema rather than fields that use the enum, [#1581](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1581) by @therefromhere

* Subclass validators do not run when referencing a `List` field defined in a parent class when `each_item=True`. Added an example to the docs illustrating this, [#1566](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1566) by @samueldeklund
* change `schema.field_class_to_schema` to support `frozenset` in schema, [#1557](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1557) by @wangpeibao
* Call `__modify_schema__` only for the field schema, [#1552](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1552) by @PrettyWood
* Move the assignment of `field.validate_always` in `fields.py` so the `always` parameter of validators work on inheritance, [#1545](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1545) by @dcHHH
* Added support for UUID instantiation through 16 byte strings such as `b'\x12\x34\x56\x78' * 4`. This was done to support `BINARY(16)` columns in sqlalchemy, [#1541](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1541) by @shawnwall
* Add a test assertion that `default_factory` can return a singleton, [#1523](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1523) by @therefromhere
* Add `NameEmail.__eq__` so duplicate `NameEmail` instances are evaluated as equal, [#1514](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1514) by @stephen-bunn
* Add datamodel-code-generator link in pydantic document site, [#1500](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1500) by @koxudaxi

* Avoid some side effects of `default_factory` by calling it only once
  if possible and by not setting a default value in the schema, [#1491](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1491) by @PrettyWood
* Added docs about dumping dataclasses to JSON, [#1487](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1487) by @mikegrima

* include `'format': 'password'` in the schema for secret types, [#1424](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1424) by @atheuz
* Modify schema constraints on `ConstrainedFloat` so that `exclusiveMinimum` and
  minimum are not included in the schema if they are equal to `-math.inf` and
  `exclusiveMaximum` and `maximum` are not included if they are equal to `math.inf`, [#1417](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1417) by @vdwees
* Squash internal `__root__` dicts in `.dict()` (and, by extension, in `.json()`), [#1414](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1414) by @patrickkwang
* Move `const` validator to post-validators so it validates the parsed value, [#1410](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1410) by @selimb
* Fix model validation to handle nested literals, e.g. `Literal['foo', Literal['bar']]`, [#1364](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1364) by @DBCerigo

* Updates OpenAPI schema generation to output all enums as separate models.
  Instead of inlining the enum values in the model schema, models now use a `$ref`
  property to point to the enum definition, [#1173](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1173) by @calvinwyoung

## v1.5.1 (2020-04-23)
